# Software Design for Flexibility

Excersises from [MIT Press book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility), implemented in MIT/GNU Scheme.

## Setup

Introductory doc for [Adventures in Advanced Symbolic Programming] has a good
overview of setting up Scheme & editor support. Additionally `rlwrap` can be
installed for readline support in Scheme REPL.

Sample code can be downloaded from here ([tgz archive](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/sdf.tgz)).

## Running

```
rlwrap scheme --load src/dsl.scm
```
